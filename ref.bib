                  represent all of these features, and we develop
                  Bayesian inference for it. The model is applicable
                  to both binary and non-binary network data. We
                  illustrate the model using two real datasets: liking
                  between monks and coreaderships between Slovenian
                  publications. We also apply it to two simulated
                  network datasets with very different network
                  structure but the same highly skewed degree sequence
                  generated from a preferential attachment
                  process. One has transitivity and community
                  structure while the other does not. Models based
                  solely on degree distributions, such as scale-free,
                  preferential attachment and power-law models, cannot
                  distinguish between these very different situations,
                  but the latent cluster random effects model does. "
